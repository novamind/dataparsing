Every weeks the same
Stuck in school's so lame
My parents say that I'm lazy
Getting up at 8 AM's crazy

Tired of being told what to do
So unfair
So uncool

The day's too long
And I'm holding on
'til I hear the bell ring

'cause that's time when we're gonna
(Time when we're gonna)

[Chorus:]
Breakout
Let the party start
We're gonna stay out
Gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance till the dance floor falls apart
Uh oh, all over again.
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
Feels so good, to let go-oh-oh.

Hangin' out's just somethin' we like to do
My friends and the mess we get into
These are the lessons that we choose
Not a book full of things we'll never use

[Chorus]

I wish it would never end,
Spending time with my friends.
Oh with my friends!

I probably shouldn't say this
But at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we've shared

It was awesome
But we lost it
It's not possible
For me not to care

And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change
Until you hear
My dear

The 7 things I hate about you
The 7 things I hate about you (oh you)

You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy

Your friends they're jerks
When you act like them
Just know it hurts

I wanna be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

It's awkward and silent
As I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now
Is your sincere apology

When you mean it
I'll believe it
If you text it
I'll delete it

Let's be clear
Oh I'm not coming back
You're taking 7 steps here

The 7 things I hate about you

You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy

Your friends they're jerks
When you act like them
Just know it hurts

I wanna be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention
The 7 that I like

The 7 things I like about you

Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy

Your hand in mine
When we're intertwined
Everything's alright

I want to be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you
You do

After twelve
Not so well
Won't pretend, it's too soon to tell
What's around this bend?

No disgrace
About face
Anything not to have to chase
You down again

You know nothing hurts like losing
When you know it's really gone
Except for the pain of choosing
To hold too long

I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

A lot to say
But not today
Let the radio break the silence
As we drive

A kiss goodbye
Not this time
Don't remember what about this song
I ever liked

You know nothing hurts like losing
When you know I'm already gone
Except for the pain of choosing
To hold too long

I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

I thought maybe we were getting somewhere
But we're still nowhere at all
I watch your tail lights fading
I try but a tear won't fall

I remember what it feels like to know love
And have it taken away
Can't think of what I've learned right now
But I'll be thanking you someday

I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
You know it's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

Let the credits start to roll
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
Be the end of the road

Will be the end of the road
Be the end of the road

I've been in a rut
Back and forth enough
Heart like a wheel
Without you around
So uncomfortable is how it feels

Every time you're near
Trouble disappears
Under the ground
But when you go to far
Silver clouds will start hanging around

And I know why
Tried to run
But I keep on
Coming back
Full circle
And I can't jump the track
Can't let you go

Tied to one
So I keep on
Coming back
Full circle
'Cause I know you'll come around
You'll come around

Skippin down a broken path
How long can I last
Please let me know
Where's the finish line
'Cause I've got to find somewhere to go

I don't want to hear
People interfere
What do they know
What I feel inside
When I'm up all night
Needing you home

I don't know why
Tried to run

And I'll give just a little

You don't understand what it is
That makes me tick
But you wish you did
You always second guess,wonder if i say yes
but you just lose out every time

If you only knew what i talked about
When I'm with my friends just hangin' out
Then you'd have the inside scoop
On what to say, what to do
That way when you play the game
Baby you could never lose

If I make a promise, I'm comin' thru

It's been in the past for a while
I get a flash and I smile
Am I crazy?
Still miss you baby

It was real, it was right
But it burned too hot to survive
All that's left is
All these ashes

Where does the love go?
I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever?
After all the time we spent together

I have to know why
I had to lose you
Now you've just become
Like everything I'll never find again
At the bottom of the ocean

Do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do

In a dream you appeared
For a while you were here
So I keep sleeping
Just to keep you with me

I'll draw a map
Connect the dots
With all the memories that I've got
What I'm missing
I'll keep re-living

Where does the love go?
I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever?
After all the time we spent together

Now you've just become
Like everything I'll never find again

[sung:]
You don't have to love me
For me to, baby, ever understand
Just know I love the time that we both had
And I don't ever want to see you sad, be happy
Cause I don't want to hold you
If you don't want to tell me you love me babe
Just know I'm gonna have to walk away
I'll be big enough for both of us to say, be happy

Oh, Can we take care of her?
Oh, Maybe you can spare her
Several moments of your consideration
Leading up to the final destination

These four walls
They whisper to me
They know a secret
I knew they would not keep
It didn't take long
For the room to fill with dust
And these four walls came down around us

It must have been something to send me out of my head
With the words so radical and not what I meant
Now I wait
For a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again

It's hard now to let you be
I won't make excuses
I've made my peace
It didn't take long
For me to lose the trust
'Cause these four walls
Were not strong enough

I can honestly say
You've been on my mind
Since I woke up today
I look at your photograph all the time
These memories come back to life
And I don't mind

I remember when we kissed
I still feel it on my lips
The time that you danced with me
With no music playing
I remember the simple things
I remember till I cry
But the one thing I wish I'd forget
The memory I wanna forget
Is goodbye

I woke up this morning
And played our song
And through my tears I sang along
I picked up the phone and then
Put it down
'cause I know I'm wasting my time
And I don't mind

I remember when we kissed
I still feel it on my lips
The time that you danced with me
With no music playing
I remember the simple things
I remember till I cry
But the one thing I wish I'd forget
The memory I wanna forget

Suddenly my cell phone's blowing up
With your ring tone
I hesitate but answer it anyway
You sound so alone
And I'm surprised to hear you say

You remember when we kissed
You still feel it on your lips
The time that you danced with me
With no music playing
You remember the simple things
We talk till we cry
You said that your biggest regret
The one thing you wish I'd forget
Is saying goodbye

I feel like I must have known you in another life

Shuffle in diagonal, 
When the drum hits, hands on your hips.

Whoa, you got my head in the clouds
Whoa, you got me thinking out loud
The more you dream about me the more that I believe
That nothing's ever out of reach
So dream, dream, dream

I breathe your visions
They pull me through the coldest of nights
They steer me towards that moment in time
When you show me what it means for you to be mine, yeah

You tucked me in, turned out the light
Kept me safe and sound at night
Little girls depend on things like that

Brushed my teeth and combed my hair
Had to drive me everywhere
You were always there when I looked back

You had to do it all alone
Make a living, make a home
Must have been as hard as it could be

And when I couldn't sleep at night
Scared things wouldn't turn out right
You would hold my hand and sing to me

Caterpillar in the tree,
How you wonder who you'll be
Can't go far but you can always dream
Wish you may and wish you might
Don't you worry, hold on tight.

Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals

Well you know my heart is aching
You don't have to break it
If love don't change your mind
Then there's two more lonely people tonight

Imagining you're far away
Just searching for the words to say
I feel it when you fall apart
Our lives are our greatest art

I don't wanna change your mind
Coz I accept you for everything you are and will be
Stay here with me now

The only thing that our hearts are made of
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
The only thing real when push comes to shove
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
'Cause in the end no one loses or wins
The story begins again and again
With forgiveness and love

You don't ever have to read my mind
You can see it when you close your eyes
Don't believe it when you lose your faith
Another moment is a moment away

I can't tell you what the future holds
Or how to live
All I know is what feels right lights up my life again and again

The only thing that our hearts are made of
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
The only thing real when push comes to shove
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
'Cause in the end no one loses or wins
The story begins again and again
With forgiveness and love

Let's jump the sun
Let's find forever
Where does the time go?
Just live your life
You'll get another today, today, today
Forgiveness and love

'Cause in the end no one loses or wins
The story begins again and again
With forgiveness and love

Let's jump the sun.... [fade to end]

I've been to London,
Been to Paris,
Australia and Rome
There's sexy boys in every city
But they're not what I want
Some got money
Some got fame
Some got cars
Some got clothes
But if it just ain't you
Then I don't wanna know

[Pre-chorus:]
Cuz baby now I realize that I was wrong
When I said I didn't need you, so
Miss you bad so now I'm comin' home
So you better leave the light on
Wait for me and just leave the light on

[Chorus:]
It's been like a permanent December
So much colder than I can remember
When I get you back
This time I swear that I won't
Won't ever let you go
Won't let you go, no
Won't let you go, go, go, go
Won't let you go, no
Go, go, go, go, no, no, no, no

I've been to New York
And to L.A
And to Baton Rouge
I met a boy in every city
No one kept me amused
But don't call me a Lolita
Cuz I don't let 'em through
Cuz I'm saving all my lovin'
For someone and it's you

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Hey!
What do you say?
Cuz I been all around the world
And they just ain't the same
Hey!
What do you say?
Without my baby
I go crazy
And I just gotta scream (Ha!)

[Pre-chorus:]
But now I realize that I was wrong
When I said I didn't need you, so
Miss you bad so now I'm comin' home

So much colder than I can remember

Won't ever let you go

Well, it's good to hear your voice
I hope you're doing fine
And if you ever wonder,
I'm lonely here at night
I'm lost here in this moment and time keeps slipping by
And if I could have just one wish
I'd have you by my side

Oh, oh I miss you
Oh, oh I need you

And I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder everyday

Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me I will stay, I will stay

Well, I try to live without you
The tears fall from my eyes
I'm alone and I feel empty
God, I'm torn apart inside

I look up at the stars
Hoping you're doing the same
And somehow I feel closer and I can hear you say

Oh, oh I miss you
Oh, oh I need you

I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place

And if you ask me I will stay, I will stay

I never wanna lose you
And if I had to I would choose you
So stay, please always stay
You're the one that I hold onto
'Cause my heart would stop without you

I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place

But we know if I looked in your eyes I'd break down,

If I could, have just one night, to be with you, and make it right,

I wont let go, this I swear,
You wont have to wonder what we are,
Cause you wont have to ever look to far,

If I told you that I love you,
But I'm doing alright without you it'd be a lie, But I could try,

The city of angels is lonely at night
Keep myself alive by candlelight
Say she can't love you like I do
Look me in the eyes and say it's true

I ask myself is this love at all
When I need you most you let me fall
I'm always here at the side of your stage
Let you live your life, pretend I'm OK

Don't you know that this ain't over
I'll be OK
I'll hold you close we'll stay forever

I, I don't understand why you're leaving me
I, I don't understand how without you I can't breathe
Please don't, don't leave me here
Take my hand, I plead in tears
I don't understand why you can't take me with you

You can pretend I don't exist,
But you see my face every time you kiss
I hope you hurt and your walls fall down
When you hear the sound that I'm OK

Don't you know that this ain't over
I'll be OK
You can't hold me down, I won't stay forever

I watch you leave
Walk away tonight
And I'm letting go for the last time
And through the tears I say goodbye
So breathe in, breathe in, breathe in, breathe out.

Its been like this from the start,
One piece after another to make my heart
You mistake the game for being smart,
Stand here, sell this and hit your mark.
But the sound of the steel and the crush and the grind
It all screams to remind who decides my life
But in time it all dies there's nothing left inside
Just rusted metal that was never even mine

I would scream
But I'm just this hollow shell
Waiting here, begging please,
Set me free so I can feel

Without somebody else operating me
You gave me eyes so now I see
I'm not your robot, I'm just me

There was nothing but cross-wires in my head,
I've been taught to think that what I feel doesn't matter at all

I've been stranded on a lonely street
Got lost in the shadows
Fell hard in the battle
Her cries and the suffering
Walked through the darkness
Left broken and heartless

I'm calling out, can you hear my voice?
I'm gonna find you through all the noise, oh whoa
You know there's nothing that I wouldn't do
So shine your light as I reach for you

It's the sound that I hear
Tells me not to give up
It breathes in my chest
And it runs through my blood
My heart beats for love

Whoa, oh oh oh yeah

And I've been told at least a thousand times
It's not worth struggle
The hurt or the trouble
I keep running up to these front lines
No, I won't surrender
I'll wait here forever

Standing here with my flag held high
Oh, can't you see that it's worth the fight?

Plenty odds are running out of time
But ours is on the border walk, baby

We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell.
A love no one could deny

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground

I will be a fool
If our love is at the end
Then why do I still want you?

Send me roses I just let 'em die

I never thought it could happen
You acted like you wanted this
But then you led me on

I thought you would be there when I go
You promised you would be there when I go
But all the broken promises I won't miss
I'm finished

That when I look you in the eyes
All I see are the lies

Oh, you broke my heart
I told you I was weak for love
But then you went around
And did what you wanted to do
And now I'm crying, crying

[Verse 1:]
Ooh, it seemed like everything was going fine
I found the love that I thought was gonna last
Then I accidentally saw a few things in your cell
I even LOL'd, man, I should've known
Why, why you're doing what you do
You, you might as well just tell the honest truth
See, I'm not really down with this
This ain't no texting shit
Know I got no biz,
But it is what it is

Could've been this, could've been that
We done been there, we done been back
You ain't with it, could've said that
Why you tripping, let me hit that
I ain't trying to argue more.
I do it all for you,
You know you're my right eye
Baby, let me show you

[Verse 2:]
Oh, I know what's been going on
Don't even try to act like Mr Super Nonchalant
What makes you think I'll stick around
I'm not as stupid as you sound
And you sound really dumb right now
From A to Z, ooh
I got a lot of nasty things flowing up in my head
But none of them are worth my time
You're not even worth this rhyme
And I don't, I don't give a flying

Chapter one we started happy
The second that you said you loved me
Started questioning us
Are we really in love?
Trying to figure out chapter three
But you're not giving me anything
""This is what we are""

But this is no book of love

That I'm lost and foolish, leaving you behind
Maybe you're right

That I'm lost and foolish, leaving you behind

Here comes the part of you and me
Arguing about nothing
You told me it's as good as it gets
Yeah, I'm real emotional
Blame it on your mental jokes
How much did you think that I could take?
So much for taking this too far
You can blame me for who I am
It's too late for us to try and be in love right now

Oh, Karen
You take it all too hard
You been talking to those fools again
And they'll tear your world apart
Oh, Karen

Gotta hold on to your soul

So, Karen don't be sad

By letting all their lies and hate
Destroy you from within-in

The sunrise insists on gladness
But how can I be glad now my flower is dead
Oh, sun, I see you happy
You made the morning dew
Now you're showing me the truth

To hold all your helplessness in

Something in the way you love me
Something in the way you stare
I wanna be there skateboarding
In a space dude's evil layer

Something in the way you fuck me
You're never fucking there

Ok, keep that last one

But we can live without dreaming

Sitting here with nothing to say
Looking out the window
It just rained, but the sun's up for the day
And there's probably a rainbow
But I don't care 'cause all the colors left with you
Thinking about driving around in your car
I never thought that we would take it very far
I just love talking, and then parking, then we'd go walking
I loved you so much
I just started watching TV
I get so high 'cause you're not here smoking my weed
And I get so bored 'cause you're not here to make me laugh
You're so cute in your space suit
In your space boots
Space dude
Since you've left, I've started to drink
Sometimes now, when I do drugs I'll start to overthink, and I start crying
I think I'm dying
But I'm just tripping
Start spiraling down this hole

Oh, space dude in your space boots
I got to be high to deal with your moods
But maybe it's me, I got to change my view
Oh, space dude in your space suit
Our love, it takes us to the moon
But you leave me up there, I'm so marooned
Oh, space dude in your space boots and your space suit

Space dude in your space boots and your space suit

Every time we talk I feel like shit
I guess I was just tryin' to avoid letting myself feel like this
'Cause it makes me feel like I might die
But every second I'm doing that anyway
My biggest fear is not being with you
The pain is so excruciating I don't know what I'd do
We're both vegan
It makes it easy to think you’d never hurt anything
Living intentionally

Alright, so this is really fucked up, but
Alright, I was sleeping next to him but I was dreaming about the other dude
And then all of a sudden, everything that he fucking did just made me cringe
And it was so hard to fall in but so easy just to fall right back out again
This whole time, I could give to you and I could paint you pictures
But I guess I could just never write a song and then maybe I'd never fell out of love with him in the first place
I mean, I, I don't wanna feel this feeling cause my energy's just so strong that,
I don't know if I'm creating this or this is actually what is meant to be
And you know, they say that you gotta think what you want into existence, but you know what?
Haven't been too good at making decisions so, I have no idea what the fuck I want, I guess

You're giving me a feeling in my head
Laying in my bed just thinking
Not really feeling like the one I want
Takes everything in me not to call him
I really, really, really wanted to
I told all my friends I'm moving on
Your baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking

You know what, in the beginning it was like we were fucking homies and shit
And then all of a sudden you started with some fucking baby goo-goo tongue down my fucking throat
I mean, even in front of your mom
Dude, as if I'm not fucking awkward enough
I mean, you put me in these fucking situations where I look like a dumbass bitch and I'm not a fucking dumbass bitch
You know, like, I hate all that fucking PDA, I probably hate it more than your fucking friends do
You know, it's sweet and you couldn't be more opposite of my last dickhead but you know what I don't know if I can get over the fucking goo

You keep saying again and again
We're laying in my bed just talking
And now I, know I can't hold it back
I'm feeling like I'm gonna vomit
I don't really want an older you
I heard I change my mind way too often
Baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking

Alright so, I'm gonna be honest
It's the super cutey shit, that's the main issue here
I mean, I'm fucking what?
Look, I like when you send me, you know, the, the queen emoji, but when I send back the monkey, you know,
The ones with the, the hands over the eyes, that means that shit's just getting a little too weird for me
I mean, I don't wanna say it in person, I just like bury my head in your armpit which... weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth
Like, why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do
And remember there was that one time that I had like a 15 minute, oh, that was kind of the best thing in the entire world, some
You know, maybe I could just get past this shit and I could get used to someone giving a fuck
I'm sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit
I mean, look, I'm really starting to be in this whole thing, but no matter what you do, homegirl can't handle the fucking goo

In your bed, or in your car
On the earth, or up in the stars
I wanna be, where you are
Even if that means, going too far

At your place, or up in space
You can, you can meet me out, as long as I see your face
I wanna be, where you are
Even if that means, letting go of my heart

You take me higher than I've been before
Don't laugh when I say that cause we just smoked a bowl
And I, I have a hard time, anyway, saying how I feel
But I'm a little buzzed, so I'm keeping it real

I tried to take it slow, but
When you're around me, my pot's about to blow, and
Everything you do just turns me on
So let's go to my room, and ""na, na""

Shit's 'bout to get real freaky I can feel it
I hope you're ready, I'm into whatever
Shit's 'bout to get real freaky I can feel it
Don't you worry, we won't regret it

It never felt right to be so wrong
I should've called you sooner, you loved me for so long
And it's been a while since I've been with someone else
Cause I got too good at just doing it myself

At your dad's place, or at your moms
And if they're both home, we can go out on the lawn
And I wanna walk around while wearing high heels
After we drank all night, and we done a bunch of pills
And then..

Shit's 'bout to get real

I sleep with the door open if you want to come in while I'm sleeping
I'm always sleeping naked cause you wake up and you're creeping
Want to lick it so much that it's almost like I taste it on the tip of my tongue
I want to touch it so bad that it's almost like I can feel it on my fingertips
I want yours inside of me, but don't forget where I like licking baby
I want to make your fantasies realities I want to be yours baby

I want you to bang my box
I want you to bang my box

There ain't nothing I'm scared to try
I can be on top or if you like it I just lie here
Take my picture position my body
Wherever you like just know I like it naughty
Teach me a lesson pretend we never met
But we can keep just kissing cause you're getting me so wet
The only downside to this morning is you getting up and you leaving
When I'm dreaming and you're in 'em I wake myself up cause I'm screaming
What are you doing to me
It's like you're a zookeeper setting animals free
You release me like a tiger that's been locked in a cage
Here I am, here you are
I want it so hard
You finger my heart
I know just what I need, what I came here to do

How I'm supposed to shine man, through all the smoke and clouds?

Cause you're the queen
And I had a dream
That you were dying
But I wasn't even crying, I just sang you to sleep
I sang you to sleep

But what does it mean?
What does it all mean?
Oh, I had a dream
What did it mean?
What did it mean?

And I had a dream
We robbed the record store
The one with the yellow door
We stole every goddamn record they had
And I had a dream
That I didn't give a fuck
But I give a fuck
I miss you so bad, I think I might die

What does it mean

And I had a dream
We were being chased by monsters
Maybe they were aliens
But I wasn't scared cause you were there
And I had a dream
We took karate
That's when you said you love me
You loved me

Feels like I just woke up
Like all this time I've been asleep
Even though it's not who I am
I'm not afraid of who I used to be

Change is a thing you can count on (oh, oh)

I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind

I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared
Of what I can't understand

But here I am
Next to you
The sky's more blue
In Malibu
Next to you
In Malibu
Next to you, baby

We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talking
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make the wish
To swim away with the fish

Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you
If three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

But here I am
Next to you
The sky's so blue
In Malibu
Next to you
In Malibu
Next to you, baby

Next to you
The sky's so blue

Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning and you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart

Make wrong things right (all things right), and end the fight

Bet you'd wonder what I do

Get caught kissing other dudes

And it seems you just wanna bring me down, down
With your bad attitude (bad attitude)
When you know I'm not one to keep dealing with the shit

They say love can drive ya crazy, my dear
I wanna trap you in a locket, or in my pocket
So I can keep you near
You know I'd never hurt you
If you fall, I'd pick you up and I'd drink your tears
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

They say good things come to those who wait
It's like countin' in light years
I'd physically live without you, but I don't want to
And death's never been my fear
You can take my blood, take my bones
My heart is yours, I volunteer
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

When you look up at a rainbow
Do you ever wonder what's really waiting at the end?
I don't want no gold, nothing's more than you
The amount is hard to even comprehend
Nothing I can do, I lost control
Something we hold on to so dear
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

And how at this optimal time did you just appear?
Everyone under their guard is so full of shit
But you are just so sheer
You're my God, you're my faith
On my knees, I look at you and I revere
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

When you look up at the cosmos
Do you ever wonder if there's really even an end?
It might go on forever, like my love for you
An amount that's hard to even comprehend
I won't waste my time with wonder, in apprehension, or livin' life in fear

You are everything to me
And I, I would die for you
There've been times when I'm up all night
Crying in the dark, so I sleep with the light on
I've heard I've got words like a knife
That I don't always choose just so wisely
But I see trees and the colored leaves
When I think about all that we could be

And when you're gone, time moves so slow
And like the grass, I've watched us grow
I heard you reap only what you'll sow
How could I never let you know?

But you are everything to me
You're sweeter than candy cane, better than any childhood dream
I am yours, and you are mine
I have your heart, I don't even need your ring

Cause I made your house my home
It's come to an end, I hate how it's been
Lights are getting dim and the walls are caving in
And it's time for this queen to go and find another throne

Or else they're gonna die

There won't be no trees,
Or air for us to breathe

Coming home with dirty feet
From playing with my dad
All day in the creek

Of knowing what to say
So when I'm feeling sad,
He makes me feel inspired

Reminds us of time and what it's worth
To make the most of it while we're here

Throw a C-note, watch it slide down my throat
Yeah, my pussy fine, I pop it 'cause it's mine

Put tears in his eyes when I milk a brother dry

I got a new song on the radio
And it goes five, four, three, two
One, that's right, it's a number one
And I can't take you with me as a carry-on
I already got my luggage, it's Margielan
And for my sixteenth birthday, I got Carey on
From the house of the queen

Don't worry 'bout me, go and get yourself a hobby

I'm not trying to have another conversation
Probably not gon' wanna play me on your station
Pouring out a bottle full of my frustration
Here to tell you something that you don't know

I'm the type to drive a pickup through your mansion
I'm completely naked but I'm making it fashion
Maybe getting married just to call a distraction
Here to tell you something that you don't know

Am I wrong that I moved on and I
And I don't even miss you?
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go

What the fuck do I know? I'm alone
Guess I couldn't be somebody's hero
You want an apology not from me
Had to leave you in your own misery
So tell me, baby, am I wrong that I moved on and I
And I don't even miss you?
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go, what the fuck do I know?

Trying to see the stars through the new pollution
Think that I'm the problem, honey, I'm the solution
Maybe all the chaos is for your amusement
Here to tell you something that you don't know

Put you on a pedestal, you're craving the spotlight
Desperate for attention, nose is bloody, it's daylight
Waking up with people that we met for the first time
Loved it then I hated it and I let you go

What the fuck do I know? I'm alone

Hello, the sunny place for shady people
A crowded room where nobody goes
You can be whoever you wanna be here
Oh, I've been living at the Chateau
Shouldn't drive but I should really go home
I don't even know 'em but they won't leave here

Frightened by my own reflection
Desperate for a new connection
Pull you in but don't you get too close
Love you now but not tomorrow
Wrong to steal but not to borrow
Pull you in but don't you get too close

I've been California dreaming
Plastic hearts are bleeding
Keep me up all night
Keep me up all night
Lost in black hole conversation
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night
Keep me up all night

I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something
But I keep feeling nothing all night long
All night long
All night long
All night long

Hello, I'll tell you all the people I know
Sell you something that you already own
I can be whoever you want me to be
Love me now but not tomorrow
Fill me up but leave me hollow
Pull me in but don't you get too close

Flowers in hand, waiting for me
Every word in poetry
Won't call me by name, only ""Baby""
The more that you give the less that I
Need everyone says I look happy
When it feels right

I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down hell with me
I'm everything they said I would be
La-la-la
I'm everything they said I would be

I'll put you down slow, love you, goodbye
Before you let go, just one more time
Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine
A little more hurt won't kill you
Tonight my mom says, ""You don't look happy""
Close your eyes

To me they're both the same

Bite marks like an animal

Sometimes the best you've ever had
Sometimes I need your loving
Sometimes I stab you in the back

Just what I needed
Cut on the bathroom wall
Midnight reflection
Craving attention
Under the disco ball

Night crawling, sky falling
Gotta listen when the Devil's calling
Can't shake it, I'll taste it
When it's yelling out my name, I chase it

Come on, come on

Sometimes they bring me to the light
Sometimes I sit in silence
Sometimes I'm running for my life

I woke up in Montecito
I was thinking about my life
And the questions made more questions
Staring out into the night

Yes, I've worn the golden g-string
Put my hand into hellfire
I did it all to make you love me
And to feel alive

Oh, that's just the world that we're living in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playing gin
You dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?

I should walk away
Oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay

There are layers to this body
Primal sex and primal shame
They told me I should cover it
So I went the other way

I was trying to own my power
Still I'm trying to work it out
And at least it gives the papers
Something they can write about

And, oh, that's just the world that we're living in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playing gin
And you dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?

Oh, I should walk away

So, the mad man's in the big chair
And his heart's an iron vault
He says, ""If you can't make ends meet, honey
It must be your fault""

We all focus on the winners
And get blinded by their shine
Maybe caring for each other's
Just too 1969

The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds (Oh, oh)

I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (By you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
See my lips on her mouth, everybody's talkin' now, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the white winged dove (Just like the white winged dove)
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh

Falling on, on the edge of
Seventeen
I don't hide blurry eyes like you
Like you

I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (By you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, you know
I don't need to be loved by you
Just like the white winged dove (Just like the white winged dove)
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the white winged dove (Just like the white winged dove)
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing (Made a few mistakes)
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Loved by you, yeah

La, la, la-la, la
In the midnight
You know it's true
In the midnight
Sky (Loved by you)

Once had a love and it was a gas
It soon turned out I had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind
Once had a love and it was divine
I soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind

In between, what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good
You teasing like you do

Once had a love and it was a gas
It soon turned out I had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind

Lost inside, adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using, please don't push me aside
We could've made it cruising, yeah

Riding high on love's true bluish light

Once I had a love and it was a gas
It soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind

Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken

But you see it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head
They are cryin'
With their tanks and their wars
And their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head
They are cryin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey, hey
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey, hey, hey, oh

Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme
Since nineteen-sixteen
In your head, in your head
They're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head
They are dyin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey, hey
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey, hey, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, oh, ya, ya-a

Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey, hey, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, oh, ya, ya-a

The problem is all inside your head
She said to me
The answer is easy if you
Take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle
To be free
There must be fifty ways
To leave your lover

She said it's really not my habit
To intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning
Won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself
At the risk of being crude
There must be fifty ways
To leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover

You just slip out the back, Jack
You make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy 
Ah
You just get yourself free
You hop on the bus, Gus
There's no need to discuss much
You just drop off the key, Lee
Ah
And get yourself free

You just slip out the back, Jack
You make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy 
Ah
You just get yourself free
You hop on the bus, Gus
There's no need to discuss much
You just drop off the key, Lee
Ah
And get yourself free

She said it grieves me so
To see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do
To make you smile again
And I said I appreciate that
And would you please explain
About the fifty ways

She said why don't we both
Just sleep on it tonight
I believe in the morning
You'll begin to see the light
And then she kissed me
And I realized she probably was right
There must be fifty ways
To leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover

You just slip out the back, Jack
You make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy 
Ah
You just get yourself free
You hop on the bus, Gus
There's no need to discuss much
You just drop off the key, Lee
Ah
And get yourself free

C'mon
You just slip out the back, Jack
You make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy 
Ah
You just listen to me
You hop on the bus, Gus
There's no need to discuss much
You just drop off the key, Lee
Ah
And get yourself free
And you get yourself free

Here comes Dick, he's wearing a skirt
Here comes Jane, y'know she's sporting a chain
Same hair, revolution
Same build, evolution
Tomorrow who's gonna fuss

[All:]
And they love each other so
Androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so
Androgynous

[Joan Jett:]
Well now don't get him wrong and don't get him mad
He might be a father, but he sure ain't a dad
And she don't need advice that they sent at her
She's happy the way she looks
She's happy with her gender

[All:]
And they love each other so
Androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so
Androgynous
(Hey)

Mirror image, see no damage
See no evil at all
A kewpie dolls and urine stalls
Will be laughed at
The way you're laughed at now (now)

Now, something meets boy, and something meets girl
They both look the same
They're overjoyed in this world
Same hair, revolution
Unisex, evolution
Tomorrow who's gonna fuss
And tomorrow Dick is wearing pants
Tomorrow Janie's wearing a dress
Future outcasts and they don't last
And today, the people dress the way that they please
The way they tried to do in the last centuries

And they love each other so
Androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so
